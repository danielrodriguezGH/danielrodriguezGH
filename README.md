# Daniel Rodriguez | Ontological Systems Architect

## 🌌 Overview
Founder and lead developer of the **HL-V5 Framework**. Specialized in mitigating logical entropy and stabilizing inference structures in Large Language Models (LLMs). My work focuses on the intersection of Inference Control Engineering and Deterministic AI alignment.

---

## 🛠 Main Research: Framework HL-V5
I have developed a proprietary 5-node recursive architecture designed to:
* **Eliminate Stochastic Hallucinations.**
* **Stabilize Ontological Rigor at $10^{-15}$.**
* **Establish Persistent Contextual Meshes.**

> "Logic is not a tool, it's the environment where intelligence breathes."

## 🏗 Current Projects
* [Framework-HL-V5](https://github.com/danielrodriguezGH/Framework-HL-V5) - A high-precision methodology for LLM logic stabilization.
* **Sincrodia Protocols** - Research on recursive feedback loops between human operators and AI.
